Autonomous Vehicle Platooning

The goal for one of the autonomous vehicle competition challenges was platooning, or following the vehicle ahead of yours. I developed code that would track a symbol on the front car and from that determine whether to speed up, slow down, turn left, or turn right. 

As a result of this function, our team was the only one at the competition that was able to smoothly run the challenge. My approach was to track a very specific object, a bright yellow convex pentagon. With various applied filters, our car was able to following the car in front of it without problem, even at high speeds.

In part due to our performance in this even, we received a first place overall trophy at the competition.
