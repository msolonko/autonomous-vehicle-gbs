Autonomous Vehicle

During senior year of high school, I was on my school's autonomous vehicle team. The competition that was participated in during May involved 7 different events in which the car competed. Personally, I contributed to setting up the general Arduino code for the car to run, programmed the car for 3 of the events myself and contributed to 2 more of them. 

My biggest contribution was the platooning challenge. The goal was to follow the vehicle ahead of ours smoothly and without crashing. I developed code that would track a symbol on the front car and from that determine whether to speed up, slow down, turn left, or turn right. 

As a result of this function, our team was the only one at the competition that was able to smoothly run the challenge. My approach was to track a very specific object, a bright yellow convex pentagon. With various applied filters, our car was able to following the car in front of it without problem, even at high speeds.

In part due to our performance in this event, we received a first place overall trophy at the competition.
